**Context:**  

 We will implement a **minimal Block Wiedemann solver** in Python, for sparse GF(2) matrices. The project will serve both as a learning exercise and as a stepping stone toward future QEC decoder work (erasure decoding, minimal polynomial extraction).

# Goals

üîÅ **Understand and implement Block Wiedemann:**

- Build Block Krylov sequences
    
- Implement Block Berlekamp‚ÄìMassey (matrix linear recurrence fitting)
    
- Extract minimal polynomials
    
- Solve Ax=b over GF(2), compute rank and nullspace
    

üîÅ **Reproduce SOA results referenced in CK and LinBox:**

- Benchmark Block Wiedemann vs basic Wiedemann
    
- Study scaling behavior on sparse GF(2) matrices


---

# Deliverable

A clean, modular **Block Wiedemann solver in Python**, with:

- Full unit tests on known sparse GF(2) matrices
    
- Benchmark plots of performance vs matrix size
    
- Minimal polynomial extraction and verification
    
- Simple report summarizing the results
